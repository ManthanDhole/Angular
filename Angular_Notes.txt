Angular Notes

Angular CLI Commands
1. Create new project: ng new project-name
2. Compile and Run the project: ng serve

Angular Theory
1. Single Page Application: When we run an Angular application, only a single index.html page is loaded and rendered in the browser and 
whenever we navigate around the application in the browser only the content of the index.html will change, the html file will not change itself.

2. Component: A component mainly comprises of 4 file namely, | .ts, .html, .css and .spec.ts |
The most important file here is .ts file where a Component class is mentioned where a decorator is used as @Component to tell angular that
this class is a component class. Here we can pass an object to the decorator like: selector, templateUrl, styleUrl, etc.
Selector can be used as an HTML element which can render the entire Template (HTML), Style/Design (CSS) and Logic (TS) of that component

3. Data Binding: Rendering values dynamically on HTML page from the .ts page. This could be done using Interpolation {{ variable }} which will display
the value of the variable from the .ts to the HTML page.
This allows to mix Static HTML code with Dynamic things.
